This project is a collaboration between Matt McElroy and David Donoso that began in 2009 on Barro Colorado Island, Panama.
Our manuscript is in press at Copeia, so keep an eye out.

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to document the selectivity and simulation analysis that we ran, as well as provide the source data for the project.
